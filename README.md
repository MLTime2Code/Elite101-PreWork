# Elite 101-PreWork
This is the Code2College Elite101 PreWork Chatbox assignment.
The Chatbox is intended to simulate a conversation by asking questions and replying to responses.
The Chatbox is made using Python.

## Testing Branch
This branch will be pushed to the repository as a new branch
The branch function allows users to create seperate changes without interferring with the main one.
Once ready, users can merge branches to the main.

## How to use the chatbox
To choose an option, you will have to type the option of your choice exactly as it is written in order to prompt more actions.
Ex. If you want to check the menu, type Check the menu (like how it is written).

## Done but not complete
Due to inexperience with python, this project was hard to make and most of the time was taken up by looking through how Python works. As a result, I wasn't able to add other functions to make the chatbox better. Please follow the instructions above and in the console to make the chatbox function properly.
